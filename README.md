Tool Design:
"More specialized tools are easier to manage and less prone to misuse by the agent. Pay close attention to the trade-off between the specificity and flexibility of a tool. 

1. Naming Matters:
Define task-specific functions like in the function names:
list_python_files() → Returns Python files only from the src/ directory.
read_python_file(file_name: str) → Reads a Python file only from the src/ directory.
write_documentation(file_name: str, content: str) → Writes documentation only to the docs/ directory.

2. Robust Error Handling in Tools
Handling errors gracefully will help AI understand the error messages better. This helps prevent failures and enables the agent to adjust its actions dynamically.


Conclusion
When integrating AI into real-world environments, tool descriptions must be explicit, structured, and informative. By following these principles:

Use descriptive names.
1. Provide structured metadata.
2. Leverage JSON Schema for parameters.
3. Ensure AI has contextual understanding.
4. Include robust error handling.
5. Provide informative error messages.
6. Inject instructions into error messages.


GAME Framework
- Goals: what the agent is trying to achieve
- Actions: what the agent can do? The tools the agent can use to achieve its goals. 
- Memory: How the agent retains information across interactions
- Environment: how the agent can do its actions?

Challenegs of designing an AI agent:
- Finetuning the Instructions for the agent: Can you clearly defining what the agent is supposed to do? 
- Set of tools: designing the appropriate tools the agent will use to perform tasks.
- Information format: Structuring the information that the agent will process and return.
